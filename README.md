# iOS_Stocks

This application will tell you how much you have gained or lost on stock options. Just input your stock, how much you paid for
it, and how many shares you have. If you lost money, it will show how much and be colored red. If you gained money, it will
show how much and be green.

Possible Future Plans for this Project (time permitting):
1) Use core data to store user stocks for multipe runs
2) Create a warning lable that is triggered if the stock goes above or below a certain price
3) More robust error checking of inputs
